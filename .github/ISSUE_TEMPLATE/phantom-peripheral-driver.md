  functions

(Explain how this peripheral could potentially be used in the car)

- [ ] Propose an interface of functions (Do a quick design review w/ other firmware/application engineers)
- [ ] Implement functions
- [ ] Document Halcogen setup
- [ ] Confirm operation on both Launchpad and VCU (can use Rpi Pico with MicroPython REPL)

Deliverables: 
- A new folder in the HAL folder containing...
    - readme.md w/ setup instructions, code snippets, and verification documentation 
    - Header and implementation files
